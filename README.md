In this project we propose the integration of several software tools in a way that a prototype of a platform can be developed, which allows teachers who do not have a high degree of knowledge in artificial intelligence and computer programming, the creation of Intelligent Tutors Systems, which can be used to assist the procedures commonly found in the laboratory practices of Control Systems Identification.

CTAT (Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools) software was used as an author tool for the creation of type-tracing tutors that allow to attend the practices of laboratory that can be carried out using the WISE simulation environment. WISE software implements the CTAT TTAI (CTAT Tool Tutor Application Interface). CTAT-TTAI  defines the communication protocol and message structure that must be exchanged between the simulation environment and the tutor system so that the activities that can be carried out in the simulation environment can be assisted by the tutor system created with the author tool.

The necessary usability features have been provided into the WISE tool so that it allows the user to control the display scale of the circuit (Zoom) and therefore the user can change the level of detail with which the devices are displayed. In addition, the usability requirements established by the CTAT have been provided so that example tracing tutors can be created using the author tool.

The integration of the WISE simulation environment with the CTAT author tool allows the teacher to capture a circuit in the WISE environment allows to demonstrate to CTAT, the behavior that a good student would have when trying to solve a problem using the captured circuit.

The operation described above has been verified through the generation of 2 problem solving environments, which include simulation functionalities and assistance, in the topic of identification of control systems using offline techniques, thus allowing to verify the use of the tool for the use cases that a teacher and a student.
